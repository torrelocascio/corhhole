Cornhole Management Application

This Web Application was built in 4 days. It is supposed to help Cornhole League Creators better manage their leagues.

Today, as the app stands, Creators can Create Leagues, Add as many teams as they want to their league, and generate a round robin schedule.

However, the app doesn't allow for the creator to add scores to each game, or who won and who lost as I didn't have enough
time to finish.
